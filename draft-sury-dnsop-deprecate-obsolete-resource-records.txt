   [RFC4034].

1.  Introduction

   The [RFC1035] defines couple of old Resource Record (RR) Types that
   are not being used, and they are not in use and should have been
   obsoleted years ago.  Some of these RR Types are even causing
   operational problems between implementations that support them and
   that don't supported them due DNS compression on the wire, or .  This
   document deprecates such records to allow the implementations to drop
   the specific support for such records.

2.  Deprecating MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, MINFO, MAILA, and MAILBRR Types

   The MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, MINFO, MAILA, and MAILB RR Types aren't used
   in any existing standards, and this documents deprecates the usage.
   The MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and MINFO RR Types RDATA contain a domain
   name that could be compressed in the RDATA section.

   As an update to [RFC3597] and [RFC4034] this document specifies that
   for MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and MINFO RR types, the canonical form is
   such that no downcasing of embedded domain names takes place, and
   otherwise identical to the canonical form specified in [RFC4034]
   section 6.2.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This documents updates the IANA registry "Domain Name System (DNS)
   Parameters" ([DNS-IANA]).

4.  Implementation Considerations

   Types will be flagged as obsolete/deprecated in the IANA registry,
   and the following guidance is given to DNS implementors in the
   handling of obsolete/deprecated RR types:

   1.  auth servers SHOULD log a warning when loading zones that contain
       obsolete/deprecated rrtypes.

   2.  responders SHOULD NOT compress rdata when rendering obsolete/
       deprecated type records to wire format.

   3.  queriers which receive obsolete/deprecated type records MAY
       interpret them as unknown type records ([RFC3597]), and MUST NOT
       interfere with their transmission.

   4.  note that the choice to parse obsolete/deprecated MAY be
       contingent on whether the rdata is compressed: an obsolete type
       record MAY be parsed as a known type if its rdata is
       uncompressed, but as an unknown type otherwise.

   5.  validators and signers SHOULD treat rdata for obsolete/deprecated
       types as opaque with respect to canonical RR ordering and
       deduplication

5.  Security Considerations

   This document has not security considerations.

6.  Operational Considerations

   The various state of implementation of MB, MG, MR, MINFO, and WKS
   records is already causing operational problems between DNS
   implementations that do implement aforementioned types and those who
   don't because of the DNS compression on the wire.  This document aims
   to rectify the situation by removing the support for all these RR
   types the DNS implementations.  This should not cause any operational
