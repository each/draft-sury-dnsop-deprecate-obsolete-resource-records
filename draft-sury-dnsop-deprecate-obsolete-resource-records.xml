    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
	<xref target="RFC1035"/> and other documents have defined some
	Resource Record (RR) Types that are no longer in common use,
	some of which have been rendered obsolete by subsequent standards,
	but have never been clearly deprecated in the context of the DNS.
	In some cases there have been interoperability problems between
	DNS implementations that support these types and those that do
	not - for example, because of DNS name compression in the
	wire format. Continued support for these RR Types imposes a
	complexity cost on new implementations for little benefit.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document formally deprecates such RR Types, allowing
	implementations to drop specific support for them.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Deprecating MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, MINFO, MAILA, and MAILBRR Types">
      <t>
	The MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, MINFO, MAILA, and MAILB RR Types
	aren't used in any existing standards, and this documents
	deprecates their usage.  The MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and MINFO RR
	Types RDATA contain a domain name that could be compressed in
	the RDATA section.
      </t>

      <t>
	As an update to <xref target="RFC3597"/> and <xref
	target="RFC4034"/> this document specifies that for MD, MF,
	MB, MG, MR, and MINFO RR types, the canonical form is such
	that no downcasing of embedded domain names takes place, and
	is otherwise identical to the canonical form specified in <xref
	target="RFC4034"/> section 6.2.

    <section anchor="implementation" title="Implementation Considerations">
      <t>
	  Types will be flagged as obsolete/deprecated in the IANA
	  registry, and the following guidance is given to DNS
	  implementors in the handling of obsolete/deprecated RR
	  types:
	  <list style="numbers">
	    <t>
	      Authoritative DNS Servers SHOULD issue a warning when
	      loading zones that contain DEPRECATED RR Types;
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      DNS Servers MUST NOT compress RDATA when rendering
	      DEPRECATED RR Types to wire format;
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      Recursive DNS Servers MAY support legacy compression in
	      DEPRECATED RR Types for received data for backward
	      compatibility if desired, but SHOULD warn if such
	      information is received.  Compressed RDATA in DEPRECATED
	      RR Types MUST be uncompressed before sending and they
	      MUST NOT be re-transmitted;
	    </t>
	    
	    <t>
	      DNS Clients which receive DEPRECATED RR Types MAY
	      interpret them as unknown RR types (<xref
	      target="RFC3597"/>), and MUST NOT interfere with their
	      transmission;
	    </t>
	    
	    <t>
	      DNSSEC Validators and Signers SHOULD treat RDATA for
	      DEPRECATED RR Types as opaque with respect to canonical
	      RR ordering and deduplication;
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      DEPRECATED RR Types MUST never be treated as a
	      known-type with respect to the wire protocol.
	    </t>
	  </list>
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	This document has no security considerations.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="operation" title="Operational Considerations">
      <t>
	The varying states of implementation of MD, MF, MB, MG,
	MR, and MINFO RR Types has already caused operational problems
	between DNS implementations that do implement the aforementioned
	types and those that don't because of DNS compression on the wire.
	This document aims to rectify the situation by encouraging removal
	of support for all these RR types in DNS implementations.  This
	should not cause signficant operational problems because these
	records are not in wide use on the Internet. [COMMENT: Some data?]
